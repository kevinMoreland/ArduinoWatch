This is the arduino script for my digital watch. 
The included features are:
1) time keeping
2) money watcher
	-by entering in your wage per hour and what percent you keep after
taxes, this feature will show you how much money you make in real time during
a work day.
3) stopwatch
4) settings
	-this adjusts the settings for the money watcher

The watch uses an RTC to keep track of time. The time will stay up to date 
even when the watch runs out of battery.
